# Hi!

- I'm Alvaro Chao Ecija, a medical student at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Malaga, with a special interest in research, especially within the field of Human Physiology. I've been collaborating with the [Human Physiology, Human Histology, Pathological Anatomy and Physical and Sports Education Department](https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-fisiologia-humana-histologia-humana-anatomia-patologia-educion-fisica-y-deportiva/) as an intern student, as well as with [@CIMES-USNA-UMA](https://github.com/CIMES-USNA-UMA), the [Autonomic Nervous System Unit of the Medical-Health Research Center of the University of Malaga](http://cimes-sna.uma.es), since 2019. 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently carrying out research projects related to the study of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity using non-invasive techniques. Part of my work deals with the development of tools that can be applied to these type of analyses, which are currently being developed for the R programming environment.

## Current work

My current work is being stored in repositories that I created at [@CIMES-USNA-UMA](https://github.com/CIMES-USNA-UMA). Here are some examples:
