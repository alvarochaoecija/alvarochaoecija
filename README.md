# Hi!

- I'm Alvaro Chao Ecija, graduated from the University of Malaga (Bachelor of Medicine, 2017/2023), with a special interest in research, particularly within the field of Human Physiology. I have collaborated with the [Human Physiology, Human Histology, Anatomical Pathology and Physical and Sports Education Department](https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-fisiologia-humana-histologia-humana-anatomia-patologia-educion-fisica-y-deportiva/) as an intern student, as well as with [@CIMES-USNA-UMA](https://github.com/CIMES-USNA-UMA), the [Autonomic Nervous System Unit of the Medical-Health Research Center of the University of Malaga](http://cimes-sna.uma.es). 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently carrying out research projects related to the study of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity using non-invasive techniques. Part of my work deals with the development of tools that can be applied to these type of analyses, which are currently being developed for the R programming environment.

## Current work

My current work is being stored in repositories located in [@CIMES-USNA-UMA](https://github.com/CIMES-USNA-UMA). Here are some examples:

### BaroWavelet
*BaroWavelet* is a package designed to perform non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity assessments with wavelet transforms. You can access this package right here:
